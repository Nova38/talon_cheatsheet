# Talon Voice Cheat sheet Generator

## Credits

This was based of of the work of tararoys cheat sheet creator [https://gist.github.com/tararoys/c538b7ae8e1f21db9a794c2c0f5becf4] and Xevs web-based Talon Cheat sheet [https://talon-knausj-cheatsheet.netlify.app/]

## Description 
This script uses python data classes to store all the action and invocation from the commands that the above resources extract from. It is current writing this data structure to a json file. In the future this will be exported to a html and/or a pdf.


## To Do

[] Use a templating Library to transform the json into a html file
    - Ideally add a sidebar to allow for quick navigation 
    - Toggle which Commands are shown
[] PDF Generation
[] Potential Save more information about the commands (such as the file and line number they came from)
